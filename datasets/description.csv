Disease,Description
Fungal infection,"Fungal infection is a common skin condition caused by fungi. It usually affects our skin, hair, nails or mucous membranes, but they can also affect our lungs or other parts of the body. If you have a weakened immune system, there are higher chances of getting fungal infection."
Allergy,"Allergy is an immune system reaction to a substance in the environment. This overreaction can cause symptoms like sneezing, itching, or swelling. Essentially, if your body mistakes these harmless substances for dangerous invaders."
GERD,"GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) is a digestive disorder that affects the lower esophageal sphincter. It causes stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus, leading to symptoms like heartburn, chest pain, and regurgitation. This condition can be managed with lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes surgery."
Chronic cholestasis,"Chronic cholestasis is a condition where bile flow from the liver is reduced for a prolonged period. This can result from various underlying causes, including liver diseases, bile duct obstructions, or genetic conditions, and it may lead to complications such as nutritional deficiencies and impaired absorption of fat-soluble vitamins."
Drug Reaction,"Drug Reaction occurs when the body reacts adversely to a medication. These reactions can range from mild to severe and may involve various organs and systems. Understanding the specific drug and individual patient factors is crucial for managing and preventing such reactions."
Peptic ulcer disease,"Peptic ulcer disease involves sores that develop on the inner lining of the stomach and small intestine. These ulcers can be caused by factors such as infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria, long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or excessive alcohol consumption. Left untreated, peptic ulcers can lead to complications like bleeding, perforation, or obstruction in the digestive tract."
AIDS,"AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) is a disease caused by HIV that weakens the immune system. HIV attacks and destroys CD4 cells, a type of white blood cell crucial for fighting off infections, leaving the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections and cancers. Effective treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress HIV replication, allowing the immune system to recover and reducing the risk of developing AIDS-related complications."
Diabetes,"Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how the body processes blood sugar. It can lead to long-term complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, and vision problems. Managing diabetes involves a combination of medication, lifestyle changes, and regular monitoring of blood sugar levels to prevent these complications."
Gastroenteritis,"Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines, typically caused by a virus or bacteria. It often results in symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever. Hydration and rest are key in managing gastroenteritis, while severe cases may require medical intervention to prevent dehydration and complications."
Bronchial Asthma,"Bronchial Asthma is a respiratory condition characterized by inflammation of the airways. It can be triggered by various factors such as allergens, exercise, cold air, or respiratory infections. Long-term management involves medications to control inflammation and bronchodilation, along with avoiding triggers and having an action plan for managing asthma attacks."
Hypertension,"Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common cardiovascular condition. It can result from various factors including genetics, lifestyle habits, and underlying medical conditions such as kidney disease or hormonal imbalances. Untreated hypertension can increase the risk of serious health complications like heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure, emphasizing the importance of regular monitoring and management."
Migraine,"Migraine is a type of headache that often involves severe pain and sensitivity to light and sound. It is believed to involve abnormal brain activity and changes in neurotransmitter levels, potentially triggered by factors like stress, hormonal fluctuations, or certain foods. Management strategies for migraines include medications for acute relief and preventive measures such as lifestyle modifications, stress management, and identifying and avoiding triggers."
Cervical spondylosis,"Cervical spondylosis is a degenerative condition of the cervical spine. It is a general term for age-related wear and tear affecting the spinal disks in your neck. As the disks dehydrate and shrink, signs of osteoarthritis develop, including bony projections along the edges of bones (bone spurs). Cervical spondylosis is very common and worsens with age."
Paralysis (brain hemorrhage),"Paralysis (brain hemorrhage) refers to the loss of muscle function due to bleeding in the brain. Brain bleeds can limit the oxygen supplied to the brain, causing headaches, nausea, vomiting, tingling in the extremities, or facial paralysis."
Jaundice,"Jaundice is a yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes, often indicating liver problems. It is a condition produced when excess amounts of bilirubin circulating in the blood stream dissolve in the subcutaneous fat (the layer of fat just beneath the skin), causing a yellowish appearance of the skin and the whites of the eyes."
Malaria,"Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease affecting humans and other animals. It is a life-threatening disease spread to humans by some types of mosquitoes. It is mostly found in tropical countries. It is preventable and curable. The infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person."
Chicken pox,"Chicken pox is a highly contagious viral infection causing an itchy rash. Chickenpox is very contagious. Symptoms include an itchy, blister-like rash in addition to other symptoms. Chickenpox illness usually lasts about 4 to 7 days."
Dengue,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by the dengue virus, which is transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Symptoms of dengue include high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, joint and muscle pain, rash, and mild bleeding. Severe cases can lead to dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome, both of which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention."
Typhoid,"Typhoid is a bacterial infection that can lead to a high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. It is a life-threatening infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. It is usually spread through contaminated food or water. Once Salmonella Typhi bacteria are ingested, they multiply and spread into the bloodstream."
hepatitis A,"Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease. It is an inflammation of the liver that can cause mild to severe illness. The hepatitis A virus (HAV) is transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food and water or through direct contact with an infectious person. Almost everyone recovers fully from hepatitis A with a lifelong immunity."
Hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver. It is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus. The infection can be acute (short and severe) or chronic (long term). Hepatitis B can cause a chronic infection and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer."
Hepatitis C,"Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation. It is an inflammation of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus. The virus can cause both acute and chronic hepatitis, ranging in severity from a mild illness to a serious, lifelong illness including liver cirrhosis and cancer."
Hepatitis D,"Hepatitis D is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis D virus. It is a liver infection caused by HDV. HDV is known as a "satellite virus" because it can only infect people who are also infected by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HDV can cause severe symptoms and serious illness that can lead to liver damage and even death."
Hepatitis E,"Hepatitis E is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation. It is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). Although rare in developed countries, hepatitis E is widespread in the developing world. In the vast majority of people, HEV infection results in a self-limited, acute illness."
Alcoholic hepatitis,"Alcoholic hepatitis is inflammation of the liver due to alcohol consumption. It is caused by drinking too much alcohol. The liver breaks down alcohol and if, over time, you drink more alcohol than the liver can process, it can become seriously damaged."
Tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily affecting the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas, or small inflammatory nodules, in the affected tissues."
Common Cold,"The common cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract caused by various viruses, such as rhinoviruses or coronaviruses. It is characterized by inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the nose and throat, typically resulting in temporary discomfort and inconvenience."
Pneumonia,"Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition affecting the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. It is typically caused by infection, either bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic, leading to complications in gas exchange and respiratory function."
Dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles),"Dimorphic hemorrhoids, commonly known as piles, is a condition characterized by swollen blood vessels in the rectum and anus. This can lead to discomfort, itching, and bleeding during bowel movements."
Heart attack,"A heart attack, also known as a myocardial infarction, is a sudden and severe reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle. This typically occurs due to the obstruction or blockage of one or more coronary arteries, which supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart."
Varicose veins,"Varicose veins are enlarged and twisted veins that typically occur in the legs. They develop when the valves within the veins weaken or fail to function properly, causing blood to pool and the veins to become swollen and distorted."
Hypothyroidism,"Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland fails to produce a sufficient amount of thyroid hormone, including thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). This results in a decreased metabolic rate and can lead to a variety of symptoms and complications if left untreated."
Hyperthyroidism,"Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland produces an excessive amount of thyroid hormone, primarily thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). This can lead to an increased metabolic rate and various symptoms related to elevated thyroid hormone levels."
Hypoglycemia,"Hypoglycemia is a condition characterized by abnormally low blood sugar levels, typically below 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). It can result from various factors such as excessive insulin or diabetes medication, inadequate food intake, or excessive physical activity."
Osteoarthristis,"Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in the joints. It typically develops over time due to wear and tear on the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion."
Arthritis,"Arthritis is inflammation of one or more joints, characterized by pain, swelling, and stiffness. It encompasses a range of conditions affecting the joints, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis, among others."
(Vertigo) Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo,"Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (PPV) is a type of dizziness caused by specific head movements, typically triggered by changes in head position relative to gravity. It occurs due to the displacement of small calcium crystals within the inner ear, known as otoliths or canaliths, which disrupts the normal function of the balance organs."
Acne,"Acne is a skin condition that occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells, leading to the formation of various types of lesions such as whiteheads, blackheads, pimples, or cysts."
Urinary tract infection,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of the urinary system, encompassing the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. It typically results from the invasion of bacteria into the urinary tract, leading to inflammation and potential complications if left untreated."
Psoriasis,"Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition characterized by red, itchy, and scaly patches. It occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy skin cells, causing the skin cell turnover process to accelerate. This results in the rapid accumulation of skin cells on the surface, leading to the formation of thick, inflamed patches known as plaques."
Impetigo,"Impetigo is a highly contagious skin infection caused primarily by bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. It is characterized by the development of red sores that can break open and form honey-colored crusts. These sores often appear around the mouth and nose but can occur on other parts of the body as well."
